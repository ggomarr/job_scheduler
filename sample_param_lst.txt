 1, 3, Mary had a little lamb
 2, 3, Mary also had a gigantic crocodile
 3, 3, The crocodile was large and green and very ferocious
 4, 3, The lamb was sheepishly looking
 5, 3, Mary kept both at an undisclosed location near Area 51
 6, 3, Mary did not keep the two separated by wall or fence of any kind
 7, 3, The crocodile was walking in circles around a tiny puddle
 8, 3, when it caugh a glimpse of the sheepishly looking lamb
 9, 3, on the corner of its shiny eye
10, 3, The ferocious crocodile immediately and happily thought:,
11, 3, "Yum! Dinner is served!"
12, 3, The vicious crocodile threw its 2000 pounds of flesh towards the lamb,
13, 3, tail wiggling and teeth sharp as chirurgical blades
14, 3, The lamb was not afraid
15, 3, for the lamb was a kung-fu master and a part-time hacker in disguise
16, 3, The lamb stopped the incoming train of flesh
17, 3, with a perfectly delivered jump-kick to the crocodile's jaw
18, 3, to then hack into the crocodile's mainframe
19, 3, through the unprotected ethernet port on the back of its head
20, 3, where it installed an elaborate computer virus
21, 3, The virus to this day
22, 3, keeps the crocodile walking around
23, 3, looking significantly less ferocious
24, 3, and lighting up every 3 minutes
25, 3, like a Christmas tree illuminating the sky
26, 3, with the faintness of an autumn breeze
