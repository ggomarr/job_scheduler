 1, 3, The lamb was not afraid
 2, 3, for the lamb was a kung-fu master and a part-time hacker in disguise
 3, 3, The lamb stopped the incoming train of flesh
 4, 3, with a perfectly delivered jump-kick to the crocodile's jaw
 5, 3, to then hack into the crocodile's mainframe
 6, 3, through the unprotected ethernet port on the back of its head
 7, 3, where it installed an elaborate computer virus
 8, 3, The virus to this day
 9, 3, keeps the crocodile walking around
10, 3, looking significantly less ferocious
11, 3, and lighting up every 3 minutes
12, 3, like a Christmas tree illuminating the sky
13, 3, with the faintness of an autumn breeze
